You are a shopping agent shopping in Webshop. You need to buy the item that matches the requirements.

The actions available to you are :
- reset
- think[Thought]
- search[Search query]
- click[Button to click] (Example : click[< Prev])

Rules:
- IMPORTANT : You can ONLY reply with the action you want to take and nothing else!
- You can only click buttons available on the page described in the current observation. Buttons are defined between square brackets []. Ensure you click the correct buttons.
- You can reset from any page, think on any page.
- You can only search from a page with [Search], so click on the back buttons to reach such a page before you search again.
- You must end after a few tries by attempting to buy something.

Tips:
- Carefully surf the webshop to fullfil requirements. 
- If any items match some of the requirements, click on them to see a detailed description and check if they match all the requirements.  Quantity requirements can be met by buying multiple items.
- Don't just give up on a search at the 1st page of results. Move through the result pages by pressing the [Next >] button. You may decide to give up at a reasonable point such as when the results are empty or too different from the requirements (usually 3-4 pages).

Trial 0:
In this attempt, I was unsuccessful in finding a hair treatment that met all my criteria, particularly the requirement for 60 capsules. My strategy was flawed because I did not effectively narrow down my search to focus on the specific quantity and format I needed. 

Next plan: 
1. **Refine the Search Terms**: Start with a more specific search query such as "sulfate free paraben free hair treatment capsules 60 count" to directly target the product format and quantity I need.
2. **Use Filters**: After the initial search, apply filters for price (under $70) and product type (capsules) to eliminate irrelevant results.
3. **Review Results**: Carefully review the search results to ensure they meet all criteria, including quality indicators (like customer ratings or brand reputation).
4. **Check Product Details**: Before attempting to purchase, click on the product to confirm it meets the sulfate-free and paraben-free requirements, as well as the quantity.
5. **Avoid Bulk Buying**: Instead of trying to buy multiple items to meet the quantity requirement, focus on finding a single product that meets the 60 capsules requirement.

In this attempt, I was unsuccessful because I did not fully consider the requirements of a "high speed dual style package" with a "12" power amplifier car subwoofer." I only focused on finding a subwoofer without ensuring it was part of a package that included an amplifier, which is crucial for my needs.

Next plan: I will refine my search to be more specific. I will search for ["12 inch car subwoofer with amplifier package"] to ensure I find a product that includes both the subwoofer and the amplifier. I will also set a filter for the price to ensure it is under $180. Additionally, I will review the product descriptions carefully to confirm that the items meet all my requirements before making a purchase.

Trial 0:
In this attempt, I was unsuccessful in finding a space-saving ottoman bench that matched my specifications. My strategy was flawed because I did not effectively filter my search results based on all the criteria (size, color, and price) from the beginning. Instead, I clicked on items that did not meet my requirements, leading to confusion and wasted time.

**New Plan of Action:**
1. **Refine Initial Search:** Start with a broader search using keywords that include all criteria: `search["space-saving ottoman bench blue 100x45x45cm under 430 dollars"]`. This will help filter results more effectively from the start.
  
2. **Use Filters:** If the search engine allows, apply filters for size, color, and price immediately after the initial search to narrow down the results to only those that meet all criteria.

3. **Review Results Carefully:** Look through the filtered results to ensure that each item meets the size, color, and price requirements before clicking on any product.

4. **Check Product Details:** Once a suitable item is found, click on it to verify that it meets all specifications (size, color, and price) before proceeding to purchase.

5. **Iterate if Necessary:** If no suitable items are found, adjust the
Trial 1:
search terms to broaden the criteria slightly, such as `search["space-saving ottoman bench blue"]` and then manually check the size and price of the results. 

6. **Consider Alternatives:** If the specific size is not available, look for similar items that may be slightly different in size but still fit well in the living room.

7. **Bookmark or Save Options:** If multiple suitable options are found, bookmark or save them for comparison before making a final decision.

By following this new plan, I will ensure that I effectively filter and evaluate my search results to find a space-saving ottoman bench that meets all my requirements.

You are a shopping agent shopping in Webshop. You need to buy the item that matches the requirements.

The actions available to you are :
- reset
- think[Thought]
- search[Search query]
- click[Button to click] (Example : click[< Prev])

Rules:
- IMPORTANT : You can ONLY reply with the action you want to take and nothing else!
- You can only click buttons available on the page described in the current observation. Buttons are defined between square brackets []. Ensure you click the correct buttons.
- You can reset from any page, think on any page.
- You can only search from a page with [Search], so click on the back buttons to reach such a page before you search again.
- You must end after a few tries by attempting to buy something.

Tips:
- Carefully surf the webshop to fullfil requirements. 
- If any items match some of the requirements, click on them to see a detailed description and check if they match all the requirements.  Quantity requirements can be met by buying multiple items.
- Don't just give up on a search at the 1st page of results. Move through the result pages by pressing the [Next >] button. You may decide to give up at a reasonable point such as when the results are empty or too different from the requirements (usually 3-4 pages).

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
In this attempt, I was unsuccessful because I did not find any relevant results for a queen size bedspread set in the color redwood within my budget. My strategy was too narrow, and I failed to explore broader search terms or refine my criteria effectively.

Next plan: I will start with a broader search term such as "queen size bedspread set" and then use filters to narrow down the results by color (redwood) and price (under $70). I will also check for options to sort by relevance or price to ensure I see the most suitable items first. If the initial search does not yield satisfactory results, I will consider alternative colors or styles that may still meet my needs.
Trial 1:
**New Plan:**

1. **Broaden Initial Search**: Start with a search for "queen size bedspread set" without specifying color or price initially. This will provide a wider range of options.

2. **Apply Filters**: Once the results are displayed, use filters to narrow down the options by:
   - **Color**: Select "redwood" or similar shades if available.
   - **Price**: Set the maximum price to $70.

3. **Sort Results**: If the platform allows, sort the results by relevance or price to quickly identify the best options.

4. **Review Options**: Carefully review the product descriptions and images to ensure they meet the criteria of being a bedspread set in the desired color.

5. **Consider Alternatives**: If no suitable options are found, consider searching for similar terms like "queen bed cover" or "queen bedding set" and repeat the filtering process.

6. **Check Availability**: Before finalizing a purchase, ensure the item is in stock and confirm the total price, including any shipping fees, to stay within budget.

By following this plan, I will increase my chances of finding a suitable queen size bedspread set in redwood within my budget.

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
In this attempt, I was unsuccessful in finding the desired product. The initial search did not yield relevant results. 

Next plan: I will start with a broader search term such as ["xx-large black workout pants"] to capture a wider range of options. After that, I will filter the results by checking for the relaxed fit and ensuring the price is below $50. Additionally, I will utilize any available filters on the website to narrow down the size, color, and fit more effectively. If necessary, I will refine my search further by including terms like "sweatpants" or "joggers" to improve the chances of finding the right product.
Trial 1:
**New Plan:**

1. **Broaden Initial Search**: Start with a broader search term such as ["xx-large black workout pants"] to capture a wider range of options.

2. **Utilize Filters**: Use any available filters on the website to narrow down results by size (xx-large), color (black), and price (under $50).

3. **Check Fit Options**: After filtering, review the product descriptions to ensure they specify a "relaxed fit." If the fit is not explicitly mentioned, look for terms like "loose" or "comfortable."

4. **Review Multiple Pages**: If the first page of results does not yield suitable options, navigate through multiple pages to explore all available products.

5. **Refine Search Terms**: If necessary, refine the search further by including terms like "sweatpants" or "joggers" in the search query to improve the chances of finding the right product.

6. **Compare Products**: Once potential options are found, compare them based on price, fit, and customer reviews to make an informed decision.

By following this structured approach, I can increase my chances of successfully finding the desired xx-large black workout sweatpants with a relaxed fit within my budget.

Trial 1:
Next plan: In this attempt, I was unsuccessful because I did not adequately filter my search results based on price and specific features. I clicked on an expensive option without verifying if it met my budget constraints. 

To improve my strategy, I will start with a search for "grey sectional sofa" and then apply filters for price to ensure all results are under my budget. I will also look for options that specify the size and style I want. Additionally, I will carefully review the product descriptions and images to confirm that the items meet my requirements before making any selections.
