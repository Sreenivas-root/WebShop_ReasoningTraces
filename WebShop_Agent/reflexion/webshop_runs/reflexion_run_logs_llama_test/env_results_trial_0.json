My strategy was flawed because I did not effectively narrow down my search to focus on the specific quantity and format I needed. \n\nNext plan: \n1. **Refine the Search Terms**: Start with a more specific search query such as \"sulfate free paraben free hair treatment capsules 60 count\" to directly target the product format and quantity I need.\n2. **Use Filters**: After the initial search, apply filters for price (under $70) and product type (capsules) to eliminate irrelevant results.\n3. **Review Results**: Carefully review the search results to ensure they meet all criteria, including quality indicators (like customer ratings or brand reputation).\n4. **Check Product Details**: Before attempting to purchase, click on the product to confirm it meets the sulfate-free and paraben-free requirements, as well as the quantity.\n5. **Avoid Bulk Buying**: Instead of trying to buy multiple items to meet the quantity requirement, focus on finding a single product that meets the 60 capsules requirement.\n\nBy following this new plan, I will streamline my search process and increase the likelihood of finding a suitable product within"
