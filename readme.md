# Reasoning-trace guided fine-tuning for autonomous web agents

Our research aims to address th challenge of generating valid reasoning traces in complex interactive environments by fine-tuning an open-source LLM using
refined reasoning traces generated from actions performed in the WebShop environment.

By doing so, we seek to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to generate coherent reasoning processes and make decisions that align with these thought patterns, ultimately improving its performance in complex, interactive settings.
